<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grid-connected Photovoltaic Power Generation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Battery</li><li>Without Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The grid-connected photovoltaic power generation system market can be divided into two main types: with battery storage and without battery storage. Systems with battery storage enable energy self-sufficiency by storing excess solar power for use during peak demand or outages, enhancing energy reliability. In contrast, systems without battery storage directly feed generated electricity into the grid, relying on immediate usage or net metering arrangements. Both types optimize solar energy use, but the choice depends on energy needs, cost, and grid stability.</p></p>
