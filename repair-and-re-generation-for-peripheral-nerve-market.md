<p><strong>The Repair and Re-generation for Peripheral Nerve Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Neurorrhaphy</li><li>Nerve Grafting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Repair and regeneration in the peripheral nerve market predominantly focus on techniques such as neurorrhaphy and nerve grafting. Neurorrhaphy involves directly suturing the ends of a damaged nerve to restore continuity, promoting healing and functional recovery. In contrast, nerve grafting employs a conduit or harvested nerve segment to bridge larger nerve gaps, facilitating tissue regeneration. Both methods aim to enhance nerve repair, minimize functional deficits, and improve patient outcomes following peripheral nerve injuries.</p></p>
