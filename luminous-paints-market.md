<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Luminous Paints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radioactive Substance</li><li>Light-Charged Substance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Luminous paints contain substances that emit light in the dark, either through radioactive decay or by absorbing and re-emitting light. **Radioactive Substance-based paints** use materials like radium or tritium, which glow continuously due to radioactive energy but pose health risks. **Light-Charged Substance-based paints** rely on phosphors or photoluminescent materials that absorb light (natural or artificial) and release it gradually, offering a safer, non-radioactive alternative. Both types cater to applications like safety signs, watches, and decorative items, balancing durability and safety.</p></p>
