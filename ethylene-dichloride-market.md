<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethylene Dichloride Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Chlorination</li><li>Oxychlorination</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ethylene Dichloride (EDC) market consists of two primary production methods: direct chlorination and oxychlorination. In direct chlorination, ethylene is reacted with chlorine under high temperatures and pressures, producing EDC directly. This method typically results in higher yields but may generate more by-products. Oxychlorination, on the other hand, involves reacting ethylene with hydrochloric acid and oxygen, leading to a more controlled process with fewer by-products. Both methods cater to varying production requirements and environmental considerations in the chemical industry.</p></p>
